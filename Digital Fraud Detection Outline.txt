**Fraud Indicators**

1. High Transaction Amounts
> Rationale: Fraudulent transactions often involve unusually high amounts compared to typical user transactions.
2. Frequent Transactions in Short Time Periods
> Rationale: Rapid transactions within a short timeframe could indicate automated or bot activity, common in fraudulent behavior.
3. Unusual Location for User's Transactions
> Rationale: Transactions occurring in different geographic regions from a user’s regular transactions may signal fraud.
4. Irregular Product Category Purchases
> Rationale: Fraudsters may purchase items outside a user’s typical spending categories.
5. Multiple Payment Methods for a Single User
> Rationale: Users generally have a preferred payment method; multiple methods could indicate fraud.

**Data Cleaning Tasks**

1. Handle Missing Values
> Although the dataset is synthetic, it’s still worth checking for missing or null values in each column.
2. Detect and Correct Outliers
> Outliers, especially in transaction_amount, can skew your analysis.
3. Standardize Date and Time Formats
> Ensure transaction_date is in a consistent datetime format.
4. Normalize Categorical Data
> Standardize categorical entries in columns like product_category and payment_method to ensure consistency (e.g., avoid "Credit Card" vs. "credit card").
5. Detect and Remove Duplicates
> Duplicate transactions can lead to misleading analysis, particularly for fraud detection.
6. Validate Numerical Data Types
> Ensure numerical columns (e.g., transaction_amount) are of the correct numeric type.
7. Filter Unrealistic Values
> Set logical limits on numerical fields, such as capping or adjusting very high values in transaction_amount that don't align with typical transaction data.
8. Address Inconsistent Location Entries
> Check for location inconsistencies if location data (e.g., country codes or city names) is used.
9. Create Fraud Indicators
> Some preprocessing can directly involve creating features that will later be used to identify fraud.
